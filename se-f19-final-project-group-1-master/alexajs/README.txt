In this directory is:
1. The JS file in this folder is the main file used in the alexa functions
2. The modified API.PHP file I used to return a specified event if a parameter is provided
3. The old alexaJS & python code examples in the respective folders that were deprecated from use because modules were hosted on amazons server instead
